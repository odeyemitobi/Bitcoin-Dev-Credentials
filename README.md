# Bitcoin Dev Credentials

A comprehensive skill tracking system for Bitcoin and Stacks developers built on the Stacks blockchain using Clarity smart contracts.

## Overview

Bitcoin Dev Credentials is a decentralized system that allows developers to track their progress across various Bitcoin and Stacks development competencies. The system is designed to be extensible and community-driven, starting with core skills from educational platforms like LearnWeb3 and expanding to cover the entire Bitcoin development ecosystem.

## Features

### üéØ Skill Categories
Based on LearnWeb3 Stacks curriculum and industry standards:

1. **Clarity Fundamentals** - Basic Clarity language skills
2. **DeFi Protocols** - Lending, borrowing, flash loans, AMMs
3. **Security & Multisig** - Multi-signature implementations
4. **Oracle Integration** - Price feeds and external data sources
5. **Token Standards** - SIP-010, SIP-009 implementations
6. **Testing & Deployment** - Contract testing and deployment

### üìä Skill Levels
- **Beginner** (0-25 points)
- **Intermediate** (26-75 points) 
- **Advanced** (76-150 points)
- **Expert** (151+ points)

### üèÜ Point System
- **Self-reported achievements**: 10 points
- **Peer verifications**: +5 bonus points
- **Project deployments**: 25 points (future)
- **Course completions**: 20 points (future)

### ü§ù Peer Verification
- Developers with 50+ reputation can verify others' skills
- Prevents self-verification and duplicate verifications
- Builds community trust and credibility

## Smart Contract Architecture

### Core Data Structures

```clarity
;; Individual skill tracking
developer-skills: {
  developer: principal,
  skill-category: uint
} -> {
  points: uint,
  self-reported-achievements: uint,
  verified-achievements: uint,
  last-updated: uint
}

;; Developer profiles
developer-profiles: {
  developer: principal
} -> {
  total-reputation: uint,
  verification-count: uint,
  join-block: uint,
  is-active: bool
}

;; Peer verification records
peer-verifications: {
  verifier: principal,
  verified-developer: principal,
  skill-category: uint
} -> {
  verification-block: uint,
  points-awarded: uint
}
```

### Key Functions

#### Public Functions
- `initialize-profile()` - Create a new developer profile
- `report-skill-achievement(skill-category, description)` - Self-report achievements
- `verify-peer-skill(developer, skill-category)` - Verify another developer's skill

#### Read-Only Functions
- `get-developer-skill(developer, skill-category)` - Get skill details
- `get-developer-profile(developer)` - Get complete profile
- `get-skill-level-name(level)` - Get level name string
- `get-skill-category-name(category)` - Get category name string

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- [Clarinet](https://docs.hiro.so/clarinet) - Stacks development environment
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) - For running tests

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd bitcoin-dev-credentials
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Check contract validity:
```bash
clarinet check
```

4. Run tests:
```bash
npm run test
```

## Usage Examples

### Initialize Your Profile
```clarity
(contract-call? .bitcoin-dev-credentials initialize-profile)
```

### Report a Skill Achievement
```clarity
(contract-call? .bitcoin-dev-credentials 
  report-skill-achievement 
  u1 ;; SKILL_CLARITY_FUNDAMENTALS
  "Completed Clarity basics tutorial")
```

### Verify Another Developer's Skill
```clarity
(contract-call? .bitcoin-dev-credentials 
  verify-peer-skill 
  'ST1PQHQKV0RJXZFY1DGX8MNSNYVE3VGZJSRTPGZGM ;; developer
  u2) ;; SKILL_DEFI_PROTOCOLS
```

### Query Skills
```clarity
(contract-call? .bitcoin-dev-credentials 
  get-developer-skill 
  'ST1PQHQKV0RJXZFY1DGX8MNSNYVE3VGZJSRTPGZGM 
  u1)
```
